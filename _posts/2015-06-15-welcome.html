<h1>Welcome to the Clearwater Healing House Blog</h1>
<p>The purpose of the newsletter is to provide encouraging and uplifting words, articles, declarations etc. to help you to receive your complete healing and walk in divine health.</p>
<p>We pray that revelation knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ fill your heart, mind, soul and body in the mighty name of Yeshua haMachiach ben Yehovah Rapha!  Jesus the Anointed One Son of Yehovah our Healer.</p>
<p>Jesus taught us to pray, “Our Father in Heaven, May Your holy name be honored. Your Kingdom come, Your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven..,” Matthew 6:10.  How many times have you prayed this and never considered what you were praying?</p>
<p>Jesus told His disciples when someone was healed to tell them that the Kingdom of God has come to them, Luke 10:9.  This is how Our Father’s name is honored.</p>
<p>Ask yourself. ‘Is there sickness or disease or death in Heaven?’  Sickness and disease is death, not life.  “He has come to give us Life and give it to us abundantly,” John 10:10.  His will is for you to be disease and pain free!</p>
<p>Whether you are praying for someone who is sick or if you are sick with a disease, it is important to approach it from the finished work of the cross. I Peter 2: 24b says, “by His stripes you WERE healed.”</p>
<p>Thank Him for what He has already done and know that you live by the faith of the Son of God who loved you and gave Himself for you, Galatians 2:20.</p>
