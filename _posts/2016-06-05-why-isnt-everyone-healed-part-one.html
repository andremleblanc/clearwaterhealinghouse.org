<h1>Why Isn't Everyone Healing? (Part 1)</h1>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-552" src="http://clearwaterhealinghouse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/healing-300x200.jpg" alt="healing" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://clearwaterhealinghouse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/healing-300x200.jpg 300w, http://clearwaterhealinghouse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/healing-510x339.jpg 510w, http://clearwaterhealinghouse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/healing.jpg 664w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Spoiler alert: I don’t know! It’s the question I ask from my bed, wishing it would be possible for someone to place me on a stretcher and lower me through the roof directly in front of Jesus surrounded by a crowd of witnesses. He would take my hand and tell me to rise up and walk. Strength would enter my legs, energy would replace fatigue, and my arms and hands would be free to move and function normally. All of the years that multiple sclerosis has stolen from me would be returned in a glorious display of power, and the miracle would inspire many to receive salvation and healing for themselves (Mark 2:1-12).</p>
<p>Back to reality. What is taking so long? Jesus is right here with me. I don’t need a stretcher. All I need is one gentle touch from those precious nail-scarred hands. He has done it for others. His question to me is, “What do you want me to do for you (Mark 10:51)?” My heart cries out, “Lord, that I might walk and use my arms and hands freely again!”</p>
<p>If you are like me, waiting for your healing, then you have probably heard it all before:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything happens for a reason.</li>
<li>God helps those who help themselves.</li>
<li>Have you tried this medicine/exercise/food/treatment/diet?</li>
<li>I knew someone with your illness and they got healed! Isn’t that exciting?</li>
<li>Your problem is, you are eating wrong, you are not reading the Bible enough, you watch too much TV (implying there is a right and wrong way to do everything and they do it perfectly).</li>
</ul>
<p>The truth is, most people want to help but have no idea what to say. I look at them and wonder how it is that they have managed to remain mobile and able to go on with their lives while I am stuck in my bed. Are they doing something better than me? Do they have more faith? Are they more spiritual? Are they more deserving? Does God love them more? And the question enters my mind again: Why isn’t everyone healed? Why not me?</p>
<p><strong>My Response</strong></p>
<p>Okay, enough with the whining. I have two choices. I can either sit around feeling sorry for myself, telling my sad story to everyone and obsessing over every doctor report, twitch, ache and pain — giving the devil exactly what he wants — or, I can resist that crafty enemy and all his lies, maintain a sense of humor, cultivate joy, and look ahead to all the glory that is in store for those who love Christ. That includes me!</p>
<p>My trusty Bible astounds me with its uncanny way of knowing how I feel. Just take a look at Psalm 42. It illustrates the struggle, the tug-of-war I have between the anguish of my condition and the knowledge that my hope is in God.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>4 </sup>My heart is breaking as I remember how it used to be: I walked among the crowds of worshipers, leading a great procession to the house of God, singing for joy and giving thanks amid the sound of a great celebration!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>7 </sup>I hear the tumult of the raging seas as your waves and surging tides sweep over me. <sup>8 </sup>But each day the Lord pours his unfailing love upon me, and through each night I sing his songs, praying to God who gives me life.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>9 </sup>“O God my rock,” I cry, “Why have you forgotten me? Why must I wander around in grief, oppressed by my enemies?” <sup>10 </sup>Their taunts break my bones. They scoff, “Where is this God of yours?”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>11 </sup>Why am I discouraged? Why is my heart so sad? I will put my hope in God! I will praise him again — my Savior and my God!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">— Psalm 42, NLT</p>
<p><strong> Why isn’t everyone saved?</strong></p>
<p>Healing and salvation are the same word in the Greek:<em> sozo.</em> It is God’s desire for everyone to be saved (1 Timothy 2:4) and healed (3 John 2). We know why everyone isn’t saved: God does not force salvation on anyone. It is a gift and we must receive it by faith. Well, the same can be said for healing. It is a gift. Sometimes it seems like a mysterious one, but it is ours for the taking!</p>
<p><strong>My mustard seed of faith </strong></p>
<p>Jesus said all we need is a mustard seed of faith. And I like mustard seeds. They are those bold little pipsqueaks that have the courage to believe they will someday be thousands of times bigger than they already are. Now because they believe, they don’t even have to think about it. The tiny green saplings inside may not seem very strong, but they somehow push past that impossibly hard shell of a seed to make their way through the darkest earth, then stretch up into the light where they can grow and thrive. Think about it. We have to use a nutcracker to break open a seed shell that a tender baby shoot pushes through all by itself. It’s in their DNA. Well guess what? God has given us a <em>better </em>DNA!</p>
<p><strong>Be a patient patient</strong></p>
<p>Oh, it is so hard to be patient. In our world of microwave popcorn, drive-through banking and online shopping, we are just not used to waiting. Try telling that to the saints of old.</p>
<ul>
<li>Joseph was kidnapped, falsely accused, thrown into prison and left for dead. Yet he was patient and never wavered from his faith. In the end, he was promoted to the second highest position in all of Egypt and saved his family and an entire nation from starvation.</li>
<li>Abraham was promised descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky or the sand on the shore but his wife couldn’t conceive. She was long past childbearing age. Who among us would have continued hoping? But Abraham knew that God was faithful. Sarah couldn’t help but giggle when she heard the angelic messengers foretell her pregnancy at the ripe young age of almost 90.</li>
<li>Paul describes in 2 Corinthians 11 how he was beaten many times, imprisoned, stoned, shipwrecked, faced robbers, gone without food, shivered in the cold without adequate clothing or blankets, and much more, all for the sake of the gospel. We would have very little of our New Testament if Paul were the type who gave up easily.</li>
<li>There are many other examples, not the least of which is God Himself. Look how patient He is with us!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unleash the power</strong></p>
<p>You can be sick in your body. You can be sick in your mind. But the Holy Spirit that lives inside of a Christian can never be sick. Begging and pleading God to heal you is unnecessary and redundant since He already healed you according to Isaiah 53:5 and lives inside you. The same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead lives in you (Romans 8:11). That gives you the power to command healing into your own body in Jesus Christ’s name. No special degrees or titles required, and you don’t even have to be a pastor or priest. <strong>A new identity</strong></p>
<p>If you came here looking for definitive answers about why everyone isn’t healed, I am sorry to disappoint you but I just don’t know. Certainly unforgiveness and resentment must be dealt with. I think I have touched on a few other keys, and we have addressed some important foundational truths in previous newsletters as well. At this point I am working most of all on cultivating patience. Meanwhile, I am putting the initials MS to better use. Multiple Sclerosis is an ugly label that I refuse to be defined by.</p>
<p><u>Them</u>: Oh, I’m so sorry to hear you have MS.</p>
<p><u>Me</u>: Well actually, I have MS with DFP.</p>
<p><u>Them</u>: That’s terrible! Um… what is MS with DFP?</p>
<p><u>Me</u>: Mighty Spirit with Disease Fighting Power!</p>
<p>Whatever disease, injury or ailment you may be fighting, don’t be defined by a diagnosis. Create a new identity. Then work on developing strong belief to complement your faith, patience and endurance. Remember, we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us (Romans 8:37).</p>
<p><strong>Isn’t it time you experienced Christ’s healing power in your body?</strong></p>
