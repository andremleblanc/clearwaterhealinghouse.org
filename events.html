  Two-part Seminar: Sunday evening 7 pm July 23rd &amp; Sunday evening 7 PM July
  30th. This is a great class for those of you who are in the deliverance ministry
  as it will give you another strategy to help those who can't seem to break free.
  It is also a great class for those of you who sense a captivity, a feeling of
  being trapped or you have gone through deliverance but demons just come right
  back again.

<p>
  The Bible speaks of regions and lands that are spiritual places of
  the soul that we may for a variety of reasons become captive. King David
  described pits, gates, and spiritual regions of the soul. For example, he
  describes in the Psalms the Land of Forgetfulness or the Land of Silence.
  Other books of the Bible speak of the Land of Jackals, Shadow Lands and the
  Land of Wandering etc.   Come and discover how the Bible reveals these areas so
  you may walk in your true identity where you are seated with full authority in
  Heavenly Regions with Christ Jesus. Shift into the freedom that has been already
  bought and paid for by Christ!
