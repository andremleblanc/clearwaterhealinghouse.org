<p><strong>Session 1: Lord please heal me, but I want it right now!</strong><br />
If I don&#8217;t get immediate results, does that mean the Lord is saying &#8216;no&#8217; to my healing?</p>
<p><strong>Session 2: Ain&#8217;t nothing He won&#8217;t heal!</strong><br />
In-depth exploration of Mathew 4:23-24</p>
<p><strong>Session 3: Get your healing doctorate here!</strong><br />
Equipping you to use His healing anointing and gifts wherever you are.</p>
<p>A syllabus (training manual) is optional but highly recommended. It is available for purchase at the training session. We request $20 to cover printing costs (the manual is over 120 pages long). If you would like to order in advance, you may do so by visiting our <a href="http://clearwaterhealinghouse.org/shop/">Resources</a> page. Please let us know if you think you will need a syllabus so that adequate supplies are printed and available. Thank you. You are welcome to use training materials from past sessions; however, please note that we frequently update so each edition may vary slightly.</p>
