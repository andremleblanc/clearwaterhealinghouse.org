<span class="normalgray">I was diagnosed with myotonic dystrophy over 10 years ago. I took no proactive action in dealing with this disease because I was told by doctors that there was no treatment. At the time I was not saved and I didn?t talk to the Lord. In January of 2006 I rededicated my life to Christ and was Baptized. I grew in my relationship with Christ and in June of 2007 and July of 2007 I visited the Clearwater Healing House to pray about this medical situation. On July 28th, while praying the weak grip and locking up of my hands was healed immediately. The Father heard our prayers and healed me. Praise God!</span></p>
